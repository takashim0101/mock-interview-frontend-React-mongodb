# .env.development

# This variable is used by the frontend to know the base URL of the backend API.
# In development, Vite's proxy handles requests to /api/interview, so this can be empty.
# If you run your backend on a different port than 3000 in development, you can explicitly set it here
# e.g., VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
